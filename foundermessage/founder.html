      I believe Victoria Hall's responsibility extends beyond just providing beds for the residents. Our aim is to enhance home and communal living designed to create memorable experiences and assist in the transition to independence adulthood.
Victoria Hall aims to provide a clean and comfortable environment for students to fulfil their academic goals.
We are committed to sustainability in the operation of our facility.
The guidelines set out in our Rules & Regulations are essential for the safety of all residents. All residents are expected to display acceptable forms of behaviour when staying in Victoria Hall.
I look forward to welcoming everyone and wish you a safe and pleasant stay in Victoria Hall.
