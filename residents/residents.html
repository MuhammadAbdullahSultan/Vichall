                <p>I have been staying at Victoria Hall since 2017. I feel at ease with the facilities and services and is very close to Swinburne University which can be covered by 5 minutes of walk. Overall, I am sure that this is the best place Kuching can offer for Swinburne students.</p>

                <p>If you ask me what level Victoria Hall is, I can tell you that it is a hotel class. I have lived in Victoria Hall for three years. The facilities inside are very complete. I like the design in the living room the most. The comfortable and spacious large sofa is equipped with a high-definition television. Of course, the reason I like Victoria Hall most is because it's very close to Swinburne University. Just take a few steps and you will never be late! If the time goes back to the beginning of my fresh start, I will not hesitate to choose Victoria Hall. Victoria Hall, I'll give you 5 stars!</p>

                <p>One of the first reasons for me to choose Victoria Hall is that it's really close to the university. The place is very secure and monitored using CCTV cameras 24/7. Standards of cleanliness is very high and the place is very well maintained by management. The kitchen has enough utilities provided so that residents won't have to buy anything themselves. Overall, I really feel at home at Victoria Hall.</p>

                <p>Been living at Victoria Hall for 1 year now and to be honest, this place is the best in terms of quality and affordability. It is right next to the university which is very convenient. The place was beyond my expectations when I first arrived. With a good atmosphere, management and facilities I would recommend this place to new students.</p>
